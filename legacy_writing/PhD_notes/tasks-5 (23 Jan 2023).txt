Desiderata for a theory of bounded rationality

* Subsumes logical induction
* Subsumes various models of heuristics, as well as somewhat more general BR models
* Can answer economic questions, whether as-if makes sense
* Can rationalize any program -- or rather decides, for any algorithm, if it's "rational given some constraints"
* Is computable
* Captures a notion of long-term efficiency/intelligence
* Should be normative -- (a) in the sense that it can't just be "an agent is a program", but must capture goal-oriented behaviour in some sense (b) in the sense that it must explain the notion of "judging a choice to be better"
* Should encapsulate some decision-making protocol that takes costs into account

Reason why markets 
It's certain that markets and intelligent systems are both computational in nature, and are ways to incorporate information, but then again so is everything.
* Multi-agent widely studied
* Meta-reasoning, incorporating 
* Implied nature of belief
* Computational costs and how markets are still efficient if you consider transaction costs factors of production (??)

things to think about now
- how can we have recursive self-improvement on recommender algos, if meta reasoning always harder? 
  Is meta-reasoning (1) bounded rationality (2) abstraction (3) a thing you do when you decide you must or (4) markets?
- markets
- conditioning on algorithmic info, how to combine programs and their info, semantics
- read barzel
