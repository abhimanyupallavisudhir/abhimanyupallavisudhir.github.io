1) Reflection, inverse limit and computable ordinals
2) What actually is logic
3) Boolean algebras
4) Beliefs as choices
5) Choice is like quantifying on all sets
6) So what is actually the optimal way to handle a disobedient Bob
7) All changes to beliefs are from information; thus computation is information
   -- algorithmic information?

1) LOGICAL UNCERTAINTY

"Twin primes conjecture is true" 
<=> in such axiomatic system, there is a proof of twin primes conjecture
<=> there will ever exist (in the lifespan of the universe) a proof enumeration program that will discover this as a theorem

This is well-defined for a computably enumerable theory, not so for others [e.g. you could run into Godelian issues]

???

Does this make sense?

Because how do you even define the probability that a proof enumeration program will discover this as a theorem?

Dutch book arguments...

We really need some general framework wherein to define a "Dutch book argument" or optimal strategy... %Philosophy of logic -- it is a way to compress information. A foundation for algorithmic information theory?

2) PROBABILITY OF GODEL??????

a) Just figure out what the inverse limit thing looks like, if only for shits and giggles

b) Dutch book argument, family of strategies, semantics, bounded rationality, everything

Read Halpern, I guess, and figure out how his boundedly rational agent addresses the Godel statement -- what is this incredible strategy that dominates Bayesianism 

c) Godel gets resolved after the passage of time
