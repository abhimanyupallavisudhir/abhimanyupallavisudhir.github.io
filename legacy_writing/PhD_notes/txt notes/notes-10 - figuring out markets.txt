Let's think about the kind of things we will need to decide in making a boundedly rational decision

Like, suppose we encounter a decision problem in the wild. We are given some shock: 
like "you'll get $1 if you correctly decide if this sentence is true!"

Or, suppose a market encounters a decision problem in the wild. It is given some shock:
like "you'll get $1 if you create 100 potatoes!"

Then the market reacts with some standard pre-defined infrastructure. Like, some agents in the economy
have learned to immediately identify particular shocks that they're more equipped to handle -- like 
farmers should look out for potato requests while rocket engineers shouldn't.

But also the agents themselves don't need to be making all these decisions. Like, the farmer himself 
doesn't have a filtering algorithm to decide which algorithm to take. There is a media algorithm to
do that for him. 

But he might choose which media algorithm to consume.

Two quick fixes we can make now:

 - give different awards for different sentences
 - charge agents for the cost of computation, time etc.

(We can then think about having markets to determine these awards, costs etc. We can also think about trading information/hiring agents, transfer, goods are decisions, different market architectures, generating more agents)
