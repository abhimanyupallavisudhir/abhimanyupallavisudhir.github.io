You can't assign probability to things that depend on (or are correlated with) your beliefs...

There are two matters to discuss here:

(1) Reflection; what extent are we allowed to have beliefs about beliefs?

(2) Logical correlation; Kolmogorov mutual information, and how algorithmic information is closely related to statistical information

(3) Explicit construction of a mathematical conjecture that is "logically correlated with your beliefs".
