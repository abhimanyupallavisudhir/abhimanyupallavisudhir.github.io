General platitudes:
 - it's programs choosing programs choosing programs ... programs all the way down (a finite way down)
 - what are the conditions for intelligence? (hint: when are markets efficient?) probably a relative sense, right?
 - can you rationalize these little programs as Bayesian inference on coarse sigma algebras?
 - assigning "belief" to a mind // rationalizing it // as-if-ing it -- is exactly like calculating implied beliefs of a market. 
   The more complex the system, the more things it meaningfully has beliefs for.
 - applications: gode & sunder, neural nets, social media
 - Programs return beliefs and so represent information
