\begin{abstract}
    The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a popular proxy for aggregate welfare in many practical settings. However, a theoretical inadequacy of GDP is that its definition rests on the notion of a ``final good'', and as a result is only well-defined within what we call the consumer-firm model of economics. In this paper, we proposed a new metric of welfare, that we term ``observable utility'', which is defined in a more general context. We prove some basic results about the validity of this metric, and demonstrate that it acts as a natural generalization of GDP, noting the conditions under which it reduces to the latter.
