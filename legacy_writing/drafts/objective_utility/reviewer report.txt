I am the Managing Editor in charge of your submission. I have read your paper.The notion of observable utility that you study is reminiscent to the idea of equivalence that has a long history in economics. Besides its use by Debreu in his paper on the coefficient of resource utilization, it was used was Samuelson in the 70's to measure well-being (the notion of metric utility/equivalent income). Then Pazner and Schmeidler (1978) showed how to use it to define social welfare and it has had a long history in the theory of resource allocation. Recently it has been used in the theory and measurement of individual well-being again. I have for instance recently written three papers that apply this idea to individual well-being measurement. Nothing from this huge literature is referred to in your paper. I think it is the duty of the writer, and not of the reader, to study the relationship of their contribution to the literature. As a consequence, I advise you to get familiarity
with this literature and identify where your contribution to it lies.
