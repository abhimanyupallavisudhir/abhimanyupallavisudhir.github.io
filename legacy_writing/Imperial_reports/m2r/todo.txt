 O Ch 8
   O Check the proof of \ref{8:lem:inv}. Doesn't seem right.
 O Ch 10
   O Make sure definition of attraction basin etc. is OK.
   O Definition 1 is obviously wrong, needs to be fixed

Content checks
 O Add useful intuitive stuff
 O Add any relevant figures
 O Add captions that are *useful* to the reader

 O Structure, language, make sure not just copying the source
 O Bugs, errors, formatting issues, beauty 
 O Check for plagiarism, figure sources

Checklist for standardization and cleaning
 O Notation and conventions
  O "p" for the local degree of f (not n)
  O Don't bother talking about \hat{p}, just say 0
  O If you do mention \hat{z}, use z^* instead
  O n for integers tending to infinity
  O \basin for attraction basin
  O \D_r(0) for disk with radius r centered at 0
  O Use \C, \R, \Q, \Z, \N. Don't just bold everything, please.
  O T, T_k etc. for conjugation (not \phi)
  O \zeta for the conjugate space (not \omega)
  O \phi for the conjugate function (not F)
 O LaTeX tips 
  O Use \log, \exp instead of log, exp
  O Use \label and \ref, don't type "Thm 2.1" manually.
    Follow this format for labels:
    \label{9:eq:whatever}
    \label{9:thm:whatever}
    \label{9:lem:whatever}
    \label{9:cor:whatever}
    \label{9:dfn:whatever}
    \label{9:rmk:whatever}
    The "9" is important, to avoid conflicts btw documents
  O Don't invent new notation for inverses. Just use T\inv,
    f\inv, etc. with some subscript to indicate what domain
    it's defined on 
  O Try to use \nhd to show neighbourhoods when possible
  O (!) Remember to put math in $ $. Sometimes you write
    single terms ("z", "n" etc.) without math mode.

Useful find-and-replace regexes.

Be careful while running this, make sure you don't start in the middle of absolute value signs. 
First run: 
  find \\left\|([^\|]*)\\right\|, replace \abs{$1}
Then run:
  find \|([^\|]*)\|, replace \abs{$1}
The order is important, because the second pattern also matches the first kind of thing, which you don't want. I'm sure more acceptable methods exist, ask Jean.
