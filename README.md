I'm interested in stuff at the intersection of markets and AI.

## Stuff I've done:

`[NOW]`: doing now; `[SUP]`: maintaining/supporting; `[...]`: archived. 

- `[NOW]` **[Reinforcement Learning from Recursive Information Market Feedback](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y79tkWhvHi8GgLN2q/reinforcement-learning-from-information-bazaar-feedback-and)**
- `[NOW]` `7f1de4ce0aea3d445afb288f15e58243f0c54038`
- `[SUP]` `72fd5a01a4248d40394bb13dce64ccc1a9fd7142`
- `[SUP]` **[costly](https://github.com/abhimanyupallavisudhir/costly)**, a Python package for automatically estimating costs of complex LLM workflows before you run them
- `[NOW]` **[Prediction markets for non-verifiable non-falsifiable sentences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14021)**
- `[NOW]` `b1d917de991507892970d8286218dc13fe519d6f`
- `[...]` other random stuff on my CV (see above)

## Deferred due to lack of time:

- **Prediction markets for latent space variables** or "subjective" questions somehow
- **Anthropic alignment**, i.e. the [``just make AI situationally unaware''](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8gH4Biog63uxMw3qW/ways-to-think-about-alignment#B__Utility___Reward_) approach which I think people have given up on too early

## Deferred due to lack of urgency:

Other stuff I'm interested in but are currently somewhat low-priority because AGI is going to be a thing soon.

- **Reformulating probability theory in terms of closed-under-***_computable_***-union sigma-algebras**
- **Market dynamics and bounded rationality**
- **Property rights theory**, transaction costs, information asymmetry and thermodynamics
- **Ways to better measure GDP, or better: [Objective Utility]("legacy_writing/drafts/objective_utility/main.pdf")**
- **[My very sensible grammar concept](https://github.com/abhimanyupallavisudhir/Docs-timepass_public/blob/master/grammar.md)**

## Stuff I don't know but would like to:

- Cryptography and cryptostuff
- Macroeconomics -- money, interest rates, debt, inflation
- Quantum information/probability/computing theory (should finish writing my [quantum mechanics article series](https://thewindingnumber.blogspot.com/p/quantum-mechanics.html) at some point)
- [List of things in math I have learned but not really understood](https://thewindingnumber.blogspot.com/2024/10/why-is-pythagoras-theorem-true-anyway.html)
