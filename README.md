I'm interested in stuff at the intersection of markets and AI.

**Stuff I've done:**

`[!]`: doing now; `[@]`: maintaining; `[.]`: archived. 

-`[!]` **[Reinforcement Learning from Recursive Information Market Feedback](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y79tkWhvHi8GgLN2q/reinforcement-learning-from-information-bazaar-feedback-and)**
-`[!]` `7f1de4ce0aea3d445afb288f15e58243f0c54038`
- `[@]` `72fd5a01a4248d40394bb13dce64ccc1a9fd7142`
- `[@]` **[costly](https://github.com/abhimanyupallavisudhir/costly)**, a Python package for automatically estimating costs of complex LLM workflows before you run them
- `[!]` **[Prediction markets for non-verifiable non-falsifiable sentences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14021)**
- `b1d917de991507892970d8286218dc13fe519d6f`

**Deferred due to lack of time:**

- **Prediction markets for latent space variables** or "subjective" questions somehow
- **Anthropic alignment**, i.e. the [``just make AI situationally unaware''](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8gH4Biog63uxMw3qW/ways-to-think-about-alignment#B__Utility___Reward_) approach which I think people have given up on too early

**Deferred due to lack of urgency:**

Other stuff I'm interested in but are currently somewhat low-priority because AGI is going to be a thing soon.

- **Reformulating probability theory in terms of closed-under-***_computable_***-union sigma-algebras**
- **Market dynamics and bounded rationality**
- **Property rights theory**, transaction costs, information asymmetry and thermodynamics
- **[My very sensible grammar concept](https://github.com/abhimanyupallavisudhir/Docs-timepass_public/blob/master/grammar.md)**

<!-- List of holes in my understanding of math:

- the Pythagoras theorem (I think I can grok it by thinking of it as derived from _scale invariance_ -- or visualizing a line rotating in a circle around another line -- tbh this just needs me to spend more time thinking about it)
- generating functions // why Fourier transforms are special among transformations // why the normal distribution is the fixed point of the Fourier transform
- the second fundamental theorem of Lie theory/BCH formula
- Fisher information
- why the first two derivatives are basically all that matter in so many places in physics

It's mildly interesting that all these things seem to have a unifying theme of "why is the second-order so much more important than anything higher-order?" -->
