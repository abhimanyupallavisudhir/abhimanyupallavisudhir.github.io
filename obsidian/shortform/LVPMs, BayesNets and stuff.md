LVPMs can have hidden layers, these are trained by the action of betting.

Traders in prediction markets kinda earn their Shapley values right – via “selling the world”. So do agents in markets. So prediction markets really are markets for buying information from traders.

Come up with a model for markets
* take the information analog (should get LVPMs)
* see if the algorithm is similar to BayesNet updating
* figure out how they “create new ideas/paths”
	* take the information analog (should get blackbox LVPMs, maybe like neural nets)
* What is the role of “enumerating all agents””
