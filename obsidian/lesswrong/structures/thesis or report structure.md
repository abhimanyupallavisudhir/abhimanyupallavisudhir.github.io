when i started I wanted to study market dynamics for AI — **[marketic agents]**. In particular one motivation is that markets are naturally boundedly rational — **[markets & br/pv games]** section.

as I progressed I (1) saw markets as a source for intuition-pumping for alignment and (2) I became more aware of a specific inefficiency of markets, information asymmetry. This is what makes prediction markets even necessary as opposed to plain info markets. but this can be solved with LLMs **[rlribf]**. 

RLRIBF can broadly be regarded as a scalable oversight protocol. Not clear how to evaluate it theoretically so I worked on a project to develop benchmarking of scalable oversight protocols **[seerbench]**.

Finally RLRIBF required good LLM forecasters, do I did some work in this space. **[cfcasting]**. More generally was interested in eliciting forecasts on all sorts of sentences e.g. **[non-VF]** — this can be extended for interpretability research etc.
